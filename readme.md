# JS Mock Quiz
> JS Mock Quiz is a sample quiz app built with javascript. Being a sample app, there are features left to be desired of the app.

The features left to be added include:
 - Style the quiz nicely.
 - Add a progress bar.
 - Let users review answers before submitting.
 - Give users a summary of their answers after they submit.
 - Update the navigation to let users skip to any question number.
 - Create custom messages for each level of results. For example, if someone scores 8/10 or higher, call them a quiz ninja.
 - Add a button to share results to social media.
 - Save your high scores using localStorage.
 - Add a countdown timer to see if people can beat the clock.
